### Licensing Policy

TODO: Discuss Licensing

*Our dependency licensing policy excludes proprietary licenses and "copyleft"-style
licenses. We accept the common Mozilla Public License v2, MIT License,
and BSD licenses. We will consider other open source licenses
in similar spirit to those three, but if you plan to include such a dependency
in a contribution we'd recommend opening a GitHub issue first to discuss what
you intend to implement and what dependencies it will require so that the
maintainer team can review the relevant licenses to for whether
they meet our licensing needs.*
